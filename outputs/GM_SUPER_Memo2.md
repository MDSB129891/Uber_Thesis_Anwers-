## 3) The 30-second explanation (for total beginners)
- The **score** is the overall “health + attractiveness” estimate.
- The **buckets** show *why* the score happened (cash, valuation, growth, quality, balance-sheet risk).
- The **news/risk** section tries to spot headline landmines.
- The **thesis test** checks whether the facts match the story you’re betting on.

- Sales growth compared to last year: **-1.29%** (source: comps_snapshot → revenue_ttm_yoy_pct)
- Free cash flow in the last twelve months: **$11.07B** (source: comps_snapshot → fcf_ttm)
- Free cash flow margin: **5.99%** (source: comps_snapshot → fcf_margin_ttm_pct)

- Cash: **$20.95B**
- Debt: **$130.28B**

## Good vs Bad cheat-sheet (how to judge the numbers)

Think of every metric like a **warning light** on a car.

### 1) Revenue growth (sales compared to last year)
- ✅ Usually good: **above +10%**
- 🟡 Mixed: **0% to +10%**
- ❌ Usually bad: **below 0%**

### 2) Free cash flow (real leftover cash)
- ✅ Good: **positive and stable/increasing**
- 🟡 Mixed: **positive but volatile**
- ❌ Bad: **negative consistently**

### 3) Free cash flow margin (cash per $100 of sales)
- ✅ Good: **10% or higher** (industry-dependent)
- 🟡 Mixed: **3% to 10%**
- ❌ Bad: **0% or negative**

### 4) Free cash flow yield (cash return compared to stock price)
- ✅ Often “cheap”: **above 5%**
- 🟡 Neutral: **2% to 5%**
- ❌ Often “expensive”: **below 2%**

### 5) Net debt (debt minus cash)
- ✅ Better: low net debt (or net cash)
- ❌ Risk: big net debt + weakening cash flow

### 6) Net debt divided by free cash flow (years to pay debt)
- ✅ Good: **below 3x**
- 🟡 Watch: **3x to 6x**
- ❌ High risk: **above 6x**


## Storytime walkthrough (explain it like I’m five)

Imagine **GM** is a giant factory.

You’re asking: **“Will this factory be stronger later, or will costs/problems crush it?”**

### Step 1 — Are sales growing?
“Sales growth compared to last year” tells us if more people are buying the product.
- If it’s growing: demand is usually stronger.
- If it’s shrinking: demand may be weakening.

### Step 2 — Is there real leftover cash?
“Free cash flow” is the money left after paying bills **and** investing to keep the business running.
- Positive = the piggy bank is filling.
- Negative = the piggy bank is leaking.

### Step 3 — Is the factory efficient?
“Free cash flow margin” asks: out of every $100 of sales, how many dollars become leftover cash?

### Step 4 — Are we paying a fair price?
“Free cash flow yield” asks: how much real cash do you get compared to what you pay for the stock?

### Step 5 — Can debt become a problem?
“Net debt” and “years to pay debt” tell us how stressed the company could get in a downturn.

### Step 6 — News landmines
If headlines are very negative (labor, regulation, insurance), stocks can drop fast even if the business is okay.
