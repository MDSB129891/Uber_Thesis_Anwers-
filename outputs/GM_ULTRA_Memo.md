Your thesis
EV expansion drives margin recovery

Core Numbers
Revenue growth YoY: -1.29%
Free cash flow (TTM): $11.07B
FCF margin: 5.99%
FCF yield: 14.19%

What this means (super simple)

Revenue growth = are people buying more?

Free cash flow = after paying bills, is cash left?

FCF margin = how much cash per $100 sales.

FCF yield = how cheap stock is vs cash.
