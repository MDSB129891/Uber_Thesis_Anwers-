## The thesis (Base case)
**TSLA: Base case — growth + cash generation supports the thesis**
Normal world: we want healthy growth, strong free cash flow, reasonable valuation, and non-escalating risk headlines.

## Scenarios (Bear / Base / Bull)
### BASE — support 85.7%
Base case: the most likely world (the company continues roughly as it is today). This is the main thesis you’re betting on.

Claims checklist:
- **PASS** — Revenue is still growing at a healthy pace  
  Metric `latest_revenue_yoy_pct` | Actual: **18.3%**
- **PASS** — Free cash flow is positive (business generates real cash)  
  Metric `latest_free_cash_flow` | Actual: **$9.76B**
- **PASS** — Free cash flow margin is solid (company converts sales into cash)  
  Metric `latest_fcf_margin_pct` | Actual: **18.8%**
- **FAIL** — Valuation is not expensive versus cash (FCF yield is decent)  
  Metric `fcf_yield_pct` | Actual: **0.5%**
- **PASS** — Recent news shock is not severe (not a headline crisis)  
  Metric `news_shock_30d` | Actual: **-25.00**
- **PASS** — Insurance risk is not spiking recently  
  Metric `risk_insurance_neg_30d` | Actual: **0.00**
- **PASS** — Regulatory risk is not spiking recently  
  Metric `risk_regulatory_neg_30d` | Actual: **5.00**
- **PASS** — Labor risk is not spiking recently  
  Metric `risk_labor_neg_30d` | Actual: **2.00**
- **PASS** — Debt burden is manageable (net debt <= ~3.0 years of free cash flow)  
  Metric `latest_net_debt_to_fcf` | Actual: **0.59**

## Plain-English explanations (for beginners)

### Revenue growth (year over year)
**Actual:** 18.3%
**What it is:** How much sales grew compared to last year.
**Why it matters:** Growing sales usually means demand is increasing and the company is scaling.
**How to judge it:** Rule of thumb: <5% slow, 5–10% okay, 10%+ healthy, 20%+ very strong.

### Free Cash Flow (FCF)
**Actual:** $9.76B
**What it is:** Real cash left after paying operating costs AND necessary investments (capex).
**Why it matters:** Positive FCF means the company funds itself (less need for debt or dilution).
**How to judge it:** Rule of thumb: negative for long periods is risky; positive and rising is strong.

### FCF margin
**Actual:** 18.8%
**What it is:** How much of revenue turns into free cash (as a percent).
**Why it matters:** Shows efficiency: high margin means sales turn into real money.
**How to judge it:** Rule of thumb: <5% weak, 5–10% okay, 10–15% good, 15%+ excellent.

### FCF yield (valuation vs cash)
**Actual:** 0.5%
**What it is:** Free cash flow divided by market value. Think: 'cash return' if cash stayed stable.
**Why it matters:** Higher yield usually means the stock is cheaper relative to its cash generation.
**How to judge it:** Rule of thumb: <2% expensive, 2–4% fair, 4–6% attractive, 6%+ cheap.

### News shock (last 30 days)
**Actual:** -25.00
**What it is:** A warning-light score that gets worse when negative news spikes recently.
**Why it matters:** Helps detect if risks are getting louder (lawsuits, regulation, safety, insurance issues).
**How to judge it:** Closer to 0 is better; more negative is worse. Use as a signal, not absolute truth.

### Insurance risk (negative items in last 30 days)
**Actual:** 0.00
**What it is:** How many recent negative items were tagged as INSURANCE.
**Why it matters:** Repeated negatives in the same theme can be a real risk, not just random noise.
**How to judge it:** Rule of thumb: 0–3 is usually manageable; repeated spikes deserve deep reading.

### Regulatory risk (negative items in last 30 days)
**Actual:** 5.00
**What it is:** How many recent negative items were tagged as REGULATORY.
**Why it matters:** Repeated negatives in the same theme can be a real risk, not just random noise.
**How to judge it:** Rule of thumb: 0–3 is usually manageable; repeated spikes deserve deep reading.

### Labor risk (negative items in last 30 days)
**Actual:** 2.00
**What it is:** How many recent negative items were tagged as LABOR.
**Why it matters:** Repeated negatives in the same theme can be a real risk, not just random noise.
**How to judge it:** Rule of thumb: 0–3 is usually manageable; repeated spikes deserve deep reading.

### Net debt to FCF (years to pay off debt with cash)
**Actual:** 0.59
**What it is:** Roughly: how many years of current free cash flow would pay off net debt.
**Why it matters:** This is an intuitive risk gauge: fewer years = easier to handle debt.
**How to judge it:** Rule of thumb: <2 low risk, 2–4 okay, 4+ watch carefully (depends on stability).

### Financial risk (negative items in last 30 days)
**Actual:** 1.00
**What it is:** How many recent negative items were tagged as FINANCIAL.
**Why it matters:** Repeated negatives in the same theme can be a real risk, not just random noise.
**How to judge it:** Rule of thumb: 0–3 is usually manageable; repeated spikes deserve deep reading.

### Safety risk (negative items in last 30 days)
**Actual:** 1.00
**What it is:** How many recent negative items were tagged as SAFETY.
**Why it matters:** Repeated negatives in the same theme can be a real risk, not just random noise.
**How to judge it:** Rule of thumb: 0–3 is usually manageable; repeated spikes deserve deep reading.

### Total risk (negative items in last 30 days)
**Actual:** 9.00
**What it is:** How many recent negative items were tagged as TOTAL.
**Why it matters:** Repeated negatives in the same theme can be a real risk, not just random noise.
**How to judge it:** Rule of thumb: 0–3 is usually manageable; repeated spikes deserve deep reading.

## Next steps (idiot-proof checklist)

1) Read the Base case. If Base support is high, the thesis is supported today.
2) Check the Bear case. If Bear support is decent, the thesis survives stress.
3) Check the Bull case. If Bull support is high too, there may be upside.
4) If confidence is low (single-source news), click-verify the worst headlines first.
5) Re-run weekly or monthly to monitor changes.

## Thesis Stress Test (Bull vs Bear Evidence)

This section shows **exactly** how each thesis claim performed, plus the strongest **supporting vs opposing** headlines.
Think of this as: *what helps the thesis* vs *what could break it*.

> Quick read: If the same risk tag repeats (LABOR / REGULATORY / INSURANCE), it’s more likely structural.

### ✅ PASS — Revenue is still growing at a healthy pace
