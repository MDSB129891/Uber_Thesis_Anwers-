## 1) Your thesis (what you believe)
**GM: Thesis**
EV expansion drives margin recovery

## 2) What the model concluded (plain English)
- **Rating:** **AVOID** (score **52/100**)
- **Evidence confidence:** **N/A** (higher = more trustworthy coverage)

## 3) The 30-second explanation (for total beginners)
Think of this like a **car dashboard**:
- The **score** is overall attractiveness (health + valuation + risk).
- The **numbers below** are the main gauges.
- The **news/risk** is the ‘warning lights’ that can move the stock fast.

## 4) Core numbers (what GM looks like today)
- Sales growth compared to last year: **-1.29%**
- Free cash flow over the last 12 months: **$11.07B**
- Free cash flow margin (cash per $100 of sales): **5.99%**
- Free cash flow yield (cash vs stock price): **14.19%**

## 5) Good vs Bad cheat-sheet (rules + GM’s actual numbers)
Each line is **(Rule) + (GM’s actual)** so the story matches the facts.

### Sales growth compared to last year
- ❌ **Rule band:** below 0%
- **GM today:** **-1.29%** → ❌ **BAD**

### Free cash flow (cash left after bills + investment)
- ✅ **Rule band:** positive
- **GM today:** **$11.07B** → ✅ **GOOD**

### Free cash flow margin (cash per $100 of sales)
- 🟡 **Rule band:** 3% to 10%
- **GM today:** **5.99%** → 🟡 **MIXED**

### Free cash flow yield (cash vs what you pay for the stock)
- ✅ **Rule band:** above 5% (often cheap)
- **GM today:** **14.19%** → ✅ **GOOD**

### Debt snapshot (why this can bite)
- Cash: **$20.95B**
- Debt: **$130.28B**
- Net debt (debt minus cash): **$109.33B**
- Net debt divided by free cash flow (years to pay): **9.87x** → ❌ **BAD** (rule: above 6x)

## 6) Storytime walkthrough (explain it like I’m five)
Imagine GM is a **gigantic toy factory**.

### Step 1 — Are more toys being sold?
GM’s sales growth compared to last year is **-1.29%**.
That means **fewer toys** are being sold than last year (usually a warning sign).

### Step 2 — After paying for everything… is there money left?
GM’s free cash flow over the last 12 months is **$11.07B**.
So the piggy bank is **filling**, not leaking. Good.

### Step 3 — How efficient is the factory at turning sales into cash?
GM’s free cash flow margin is **5.99%**.
That’s okay-ish: it makes cash, but not a ‘money printer.’

### Step 4 — Is the stock price cheap or expensive vs cash?
GM’s free cash flow yield is **14.19%**.
That often means the stock looks **cheap** relative to cash (but check if cash is sustainable).

### Step 5 — The big boss fight: debt
GM has net debt of **$109.33B** and net debt divided by free cash flow of **9.87x**.
That’s a **heavy backpack**. If the world gets worse, debt reduces flexibility.
